# DL_Model_Optimization_Implementation
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that explore the foundations and practical applications of model optimization techniques in machine learning. These exercises aim to demonstrate both theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation of core optimization concepts using built-in tools from popular machine learning libraries.

## üìÅ Notebooks

### 1. Model_Optimization_Training_Algorithms_Exercise.ipynb
- **Overview:** Introduction to optimization in ML, covering basic gradient descent and variations.
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Loss function visualization
  - Gradient descent walkthrough
  - Optimizer behaviors using scikit-learn or PyTorch/TensorFlow

### 2. Model_Optimization_Training_Algorithms_Exercise_2.ipynb
- **Overview:** Further exploration of optimization strategies including comparisons and practical implications.
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Comparison between different optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc.)
  - Learning rate analysis
  - Convergence visualization and discussion

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To run the notebooks, install the following:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
# Or add PyTorch / TensorFlow depending on your use

üìå Purpose
These notebooks are part of a personal deep learning and ML research curriculum, focused on developing intuition behind optimization algorithms that power modern AI.
