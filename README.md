# DL_Model_Optimization_Implementation
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that explore the foundations and practical applications of model optimization techniques in machine learning. These exercises aim to demonstrate both theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation of core optimization concepts using built-in tools from popular machine learning libraries.
